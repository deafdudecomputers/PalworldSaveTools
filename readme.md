### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Replace the Map File

For **host/co-op**, the save folder is typically located at:

```

```
steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\

# Host Swap Process in Palworld (UID Explained)

## Background
- **Host always uses `0001.sav`** ‚Äî same UID for whoever hosts.
- Each client uses a unique **regular UID save** (e.g. `123xxx.sav`, `987xxx.sav`).

## Key Prerequisite
Both players (old host and new host) **must have their regular saves generated**.  
This happens by joining the host‚Äôs world and creating a new character if none exists.

---

## Step-by-Step Host Swap

### 1. Ensure Regular Saves Exist
- Player A (old host) should have a regular save (e.g. `123xxx.sav`).
- Player B (new host) should have a regular save (e.g. `987xxx.sav`).

### 2. Swap Old Host‚Äôs Host Save to Regular Save
- Use PalworldSaveTools **Fix Host Save** to swap:
  - Old host‚Äôs `0001.sav` ‚Üí `123xxx.sav`  
  (This moves old host‚Äôs progress from host slot to their regular player slot.)

### 3. Swap New Host‚Äôs Regular Save to Host Save
- Use PalworldSaveTools **Fix Host Save** to swap:
  - New host‚Äôs `987xxx.sav` ‚Üí `0001.sav`  
  (This moves new host‚Äôs progress into the host slot.)

---

## Result
- Player B is now the host with their own character and pals in `0001.sav`.
- Player A becomes a client with their original progress in `123xxx.sav`.

---

## Summary
- **Swap old host‚Äôs `0001.sav` to their regular UID save.**
- **Swap new host‚Äôs regular UID save to `0001.sav`.**

---

This process lets both players keep their characters and pals intact while swapping host roles.

# üêû Known Bugs / Issues

## 1. Steam ‚ûù GamePass Converter Not Working
**Issue:** Changes made via the converter are not applied or retained.  
**Steps to Fix:**
1. Close the GamePass version of Palworld.  
2. Wait a few minutes.  
3. Run the Steam ‚ûù GamePass converter.  
4. Wait again.  
5. Launch Palworld on GamePass and confirm the updated save works.  

---

## 2. `struct.error` When Parsing Save
**Cause:** The save file format is outdated and incompatible with current tools.  
**Solution:**  
- Place the outdated save into **Solo, Coop, or Dedicated Server** mode.  
- Load the game once to trigger an **automatic structure update**.  
- Ensure the save was last updated **on or after the latest game patch**.  

---

## 3. `PalworldSaveTools.exe - System Error`
**Error Message:**
  
```
The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found.
Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.

```

**Cause:** Some PCs (barebones setups, sandboxes, or VMs) do not include this DLL, which the tools require to run. 
 
**Solution:**  
- Install the latest **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**  
- Download here: [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015‚Äì2022 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
